# Welcome to Food Tinder

This is a complete Full-stack MERN project. 

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.12. On Backend side Node.js, Express and MongoDB were used. 

## About

The project is about engaging customers in a funny way and get insights about what products they like. To do that, I wanted the customer to be able to do it like playing a game of “Food Tinder”.

In case you’re not familiar with Tinder and how it works, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sIyYQLSYng) is a YouTube videos that might be helpful for you :)
